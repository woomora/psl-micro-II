## Policies

- Respect your classmates and instructor. Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.
- **No electronic devices (computers, cellphones, tablets) are allowed during lectures.** Want evidence? [Read this](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/business/laptops-not-during-lecture-or-meeting.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fbusiness&action=click&contentCollection=business&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=12&pgtype=sectionfront).
- Academic integrity is mandatory. Cite all sources properly. **Cheating during exams or using ChatGPT as a substitute rather than a complement will result in strict penalties.**
- If the classroom environment becomes disruptive (e.g., excessive noise), the class will be terminated, and the subject will be considered complete.

A bakery has an increasing MC curve. On the AC curve, profit is zero. When MC > AC, the AC curve slopes upward. The other isoprofit curves represent higher levels of profit, and MC passes through the lowest points of all the isoprofit curves.

```{r out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}

```

The bakery is a price-taker. The market price is $P^*$ = 2.35. If you choose a higher price, customers will go to other bakeries. Your feasible set of prices and quantities is the area below the horizontal line at $P^*$.

The point of highest profit in the feasible set is point A, where the 80 isoprofit curve is tangent to the feasible set. You should make 120 loaves per day, and sell them at the market price, 2.35 each.

```{r out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f8-5c.png")

Your profit-maximizing quantity, $Q^*$ = 120, is found at the point where $P^*$ = MC: the marginal cost of the 120th loaf is equal to the market price.

$$MC=P \iff (\textit{slope of isoprofit} = 0)$$

# (Competitive) Supply

```{r out.width="65%", fig.align='center'}

When the market price is 2.35, you supply 120 loaves. **Note**: Firm chooses quantity, not price.

What would you do if the price changed?

# (Competitive) Supply

```{r out.width="65%", fig.align='center'}

If $P^*$ were to rise to 3.20, you could reach a higher isoprofit curve. To maximize profit you should produce 163 loaves per day.

```{r out.width="65%", fig.align='center'}

If the price falls to 1.52 you could reach only the lightest blue curve. Your best choice would be 66 loaves, and your economic profit would be zero.

In each case, you choose the point on your marginal cost curve where **MC = market price**. Your **marginal cost curve** is your **supply curve**.

There are 50 bakeries, all with the same cost functions. If the market price is â‚¬2.35, each bakery will produce 120 loaves.

---
# (Competitive) Supply

```{r out.width="65%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f8-7b.png")

When P = 2.35, each bakery supplies 120 loaves, and the market supply is 50 Ã— 120 = 6,000 loaves.

---
# (Competitive) Supply

```{r out.width="65%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f8-7c.png")
```

At a price of 1.52 they each supply 66 loaves, and market supply is 3,300. The market supply curve looks like the firmâ€™s supply curve, but the scale on the horizontal axis is different.

---
# (Competitive) Supply

```{r out.width="65%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f8-7c.png")
```

If the bakeries had different cost functions, then at a price of 2.35 some bakeries would produce more loaves than others, but we could still add them together to find market supply.

## Perfectly competitive markets 
]

.pull-left[

A hypothetical market in which:

1. The good or service being exchanged is homogeneous
2. Very large number of potential buyers and sellers
3. Buyers and sellers all act independently of one another
4. Price information easily available to buyers and sellers

]

--

.pull-right[

Some characteristics:

- **Law of One Price**: All transactions take place at a **single price**.
- At that price, **the market clears (supply = demand)**.
- Buyers and sellers are all **price-takers**.
- All potential **gains from trade** are realized.

# Summary

- Competitive markets work under a specific set of assumptions
- Firm behavior varies substantially with market structure
- Policies have implications for welfare and efficiency
- Need to understand all of the above to inform and design policy
